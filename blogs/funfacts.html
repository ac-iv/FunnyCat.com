            <p>Cats are fascinating creatures that have been companions to humans for thousands of years. Despite their popularity, there are many intriguing facts about cats that are less known. Here are some fun cat facts that might surprise you.</p>
            
            <h2>Cats Can Make Over 100 Sounds</h2>
            <p>While dogs can only make around 10 sounds, cats can make over 100 different sounds ranging from meows to purrs, hisses, and more.</p>
            
            <h2>They Have a Special Spine</h2>
            <p>Cats have an exceptionally flexible spine, thanks to their 53 loosely fitting vertebrae. This flexibility allows them to twist and turn their bodies mid-air while falling.</p>
            
            <h2>Their Whiskers Are Highly Sensitive</h2>
            <p>Cat whiskers are not just for looks; they are highly sensitive tactile hairs called vibrissae. They help cats detect changes in their surroundings, measure widths, and navigate in the dark.</p>
            
            <h2>Cats Walk Like Camels and Giraffes</h2>
            <p>Cats have a unique walking pattern where they move their right feet first, followed by their left feet, moving both legs on one side before the other. This walking pattern is similar to camels and giraffes.</p>
            
            <h2>They Can't Taste Sweetness</h2>
            <p>Unlike humans, cats lack the taste receptors for sweetness. This is why they are not drawn to sweet foods.</p>
            
            <h2>Cats Use Their Ears to Communicate</h2>
            <p>A cat's ears are highly expressive and can rotate up to 180 degrees. They use their ears to communicate their mood and intentions to other animals and humans.</p>
            
            <h2>The World's Oldest Cat</h2>
            <p>The oldest recorded cat lived to be 38 years old. Named Creme Puff, she was born in 1967 and lived until 2005.</p>
            
            <h2>Cats Have a Third Eyelid</h2>
            <p>Known as the haw, this third eyelid is a protective feature that helps keep the eye lubricated and free of debris. It's usually only seen when a cat is sleepy or unwell.</p>
            
            <h2>They Spend 70% of Their Lives Sleeping</h2>
            <p>Cats are famous for their love of sleep. On average, they spend about 70% of their lives sleeping, which translates to about 13-16 hours a day.</p>
            
            <h2>Cats Have Unique Noseprints</h2>
            <p>Just like human fingerprints, each cat has a unique noseprint. This could technically be used to identify them, though it's not a common practice.</p>
            
            <p>These are just a few of the countless fascinating facts about cats. Their mysterious and intriguing nature is part of what makes them such beloved companions.</p>
