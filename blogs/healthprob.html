            <h4>March 21, 2024</h4>
            <p>Cats may seem independent and resilient, but they can be vulnerable to several health issues. Recognizing common health problems and knowing how to prevent them can help ensure your feline friend leads a long, healthy life. Here are some tips to help you stay on top of your cat's health.</p>
            
            <h2>Dental Disease</h2>
            <p>Dental disease is one of the most common health issues in cats, leading to pain, bad breath, and tooth loss. Regular dental check-ups and cleanings, along with dental treats and toys, can help maintain oral health.</p>
            
            <h2>Obesity</h2>
            <p>Obesity can lead to serious health problems like diabetes, liver disease, and joint pain. Keeping your cat active and managing their diet with measured meals and limited treats can help prevent obesity.</p>
            
            <h2>Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)</h2>
            <p>UTIs are painful and can lead to more serious kidney issues. Providing plenty of fresh water, maintaining a clean litter box, and ensuring a stress-free environment can reduce the risk of UTIs.</p>
            
            <h2>Feline Diabetes</h2>
            <p>This metabolic disorder is often related to obesity. Feeding a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet and maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent diabetes in cats.</p>
            
            <h2>Chronic Kidney Disease</h2>
            <p>Common in older cats, kidney disease can be managed with early detection. A balanced diet and regular vet checks are crucial for early diagnosis and treatment.</p>
            
            <h2>Parasites</h2>
            <p>Fleas, ticks, and worms can cause a range of health issues. Regular use of preventive treatments and keeping your cat's environment clean can help keep parasites at bay.</p>
            
            <h2>Respiratory Infections</h2>
            <p>Cats can suffer from various respiratory infections, some of which are preventable with vaccinations. Keeping up with your cat's vaccination schedule is key.</p>
            
            <p>Understanding these common health issues and their prevention can significantly contribute to your cat's overall well-being. Regular vet visits, a balanced diet, and a safe environment are essential for a healthy cat.</p>
